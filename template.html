                What is Remote Work ?
            </h2>
            <p class='p-benifit'>
                Remote work is on the rise. How do people work remotely, why do they work
                remotely and what are some common misconceptions about remote work?
                Remote work is on the rise. While having the ability to work from outside
                of a corporate office has been feasible for a few decades, working remotely
                is only now becoming mainstream.
                You may have even heard the phrase tossed around in casual conversation:
                “I’m working remotely now!” or “I’ve been able to travel and take
                my job with me!” You nod your head as you listen to these people extol
                the flexibility of their lifestyles and the benefits that they’ve seen in
                their professional lives because they can work remotely, but you still have
                a few questions.
                <br></br>
                Remote work is a working style that allows professionals to work outside
                of a traditional office environment. It is based on the concept that work
                does not need to be done in a specific place to be executed successfully.
                Think of it this way: instead of commuting to an office each day to work
                from a designated desk, remote employees can execute their projects and
                surpass their goals wherever they please. People have the flexibility to
                design their days so that their professional and personal lives can be
                experienced to their fullest potential and coexist peacefully.
                There has been a cultural paradigm shift in what society deems to be an
                appropriate workplace - and remote work has capitalized off of that newfound
                freedom.

                The Benefits and Challenges of Working From Home
            </h2>
            <p class='p-benifit'>
                Many people are working from home for the first time because of COVID-19.
                Others are more seasoned remote workers. Whatever your circumstances,
                working from home is likely playing a larger part in your life,
                or that of people you live with, than it ever has before.
                At its best, working from home benefits everyone:
                you, your family or household, and your organization.
                Remain connected and positive, and you can work productively while
                maintaining a fulfilling home life – all without the stress of a daily
                commute.
                As Sarah Harvey says in her book "The Ultimate A-Z of Home Working,"
                "Organizations that don't offer home working may be missing out on a
                large pool of talent, many of whom now value home working more than
                they value a bonus."
                However, there are challenges. Managers may be concerned whether home
                workers are in fact working. Meanwhile, many remote employees can feel
                isolated. They withdraw from the team dynamic, and suffer from stress
                and anxiety. That's why it is vital to maintain contact with your
                co-workers, and to cultivate a sense of belonging.

                Disadvantages of working remotely
            </h2>
            <p class='p-benifit'>
                Very few home offices are ergonomically designed, and many employees do not
                even work from an office. Kitchen tables, chairs, and couches are all serving
                double duty as workspaces for many Americans.
                While these spaces served their purpose during the rapid transition to remote
                work that occurred in 2020, they present major health challenges by forcing
                employees to work in slouched positions.
                For example, a laptop that sits below your line of sight can force you to bend
                your head and neck. The wrong chair can force you to slouch forward, creating
                curvatures in your back and shoulders. A lack of foot support can also force
                the body forward out of a neutral, aligned position.
                All of these problems create poor posture, and that poor posture can lead to
                a host of painful problems.
                <br></br>
                The head, neck, and shoulders often get the most attention when it comes to
                remote work health challenges. However, working from home can also create
                vision problems.
                One of the earliest signs of a problem is often eye fatigue.
                Feelings of soreness, a burning sensation, and even blurry vision
                indicate that the eyes are strained from too much time close to a screen.
                Home offices often contribute to eye strain because they place the
                computer too close to your eyes. Without the proper distance from your eyes,
                the screen tires your eyes out quickly, especially over the course of a full
                workday.
                In addition, poor work from home setups can lead to computer vision syndrome.
                This syndrome includes red, bloodshot eyes; inflammation, dryness, and blurry
                vision. Severe cases can even lead to permanent vision damage.

                Working Securely at Home
            </h2>
            <p class='p-benifit'>
                At home, you're responsible for creating your own working environment,
                often in a space quite unlike an office. You also need to make sure that you
                stay mentally and physically healthy.
                You're likely accessing your organization's data and systems remotely,
                so be secure. Take all the protective measures you would when working in the
                office, and more.
                Use only secure WiFi networks that require a password for access.
                Maintain strong password protocols and ensure that you're using a Virtual
                Private Network (VPN). Your organization will likely insist on this anyway,
                but if not, ask them about it. It greatly improves cybersecurity.
                When you back up your data, don't save sensitive material to removable
                media, such as USB sticks or flash drives. These can transfer malware and
                viruses, and you can also lose them easily.
                Lock your computer when it's unattended, even if you're only going to be
                away from it for a few minutes. Your partner and family likely aren't
                security risks, but they shouldn't be allowed to see confidential data,
                while random keystrokes by your children or pets can cause havoc!
                Keep your devices in a safe place, out of sight of anyone who might be
                passing your window or work space. This is particularly important if your
                home can be accessed by anyone you don't know well.
